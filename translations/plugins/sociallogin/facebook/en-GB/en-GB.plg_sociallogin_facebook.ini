PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_UNLINK_LABEL="Unlink Facebook"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_UNLINK_DESC="Unlinks your user on this site from your Facebook account"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_FIELD_APPID_LABEL="Facebook Application ID"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_DESC="When enabled allows users to log in despite not having linked their Facebook account to their site user account.

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL="Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Facebook but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or Facebook User ID. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The new Joomla! user will have a username derived from the Facebook login, the same email address as the Facebook account and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Facebook login."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_FIELD_FORCENEW_LABEL="Ignore Joomla! setting for creating user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_FIELD_FORCENEW_DESC="When both this option and the 'Create new user accounts' option above are enabled a new user will always be created, even if you have disabled user registration in the options of Joomla's Users page.

This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_LABEL="Button styling"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_DESC="When enabled custom CSS for login, link and unlink button styling will be output to the page header. Disable this option if you intend to use your own CSS to style the buttons."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_FACEBOOK_FIELD_ICONCLASS_DESC="The icon CSS class to use in the login, link and unlink buttons. Useful to use an icon font such as FontAwesome or Glyphicons to render the logo. If it's left empty a transparent PNG image will be used instead - but it's slower to load!"
