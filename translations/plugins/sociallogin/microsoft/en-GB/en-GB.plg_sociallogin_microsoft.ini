PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT="Akeeba Social Login - Microsoft Account integration"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_DESCRIPTION="Allows social login with Microsoft Account accounts."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_LOGIN_LABEL="<small>Login</small>"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_LOGIN_DESC="Login with your Microsoft Account. A new account will be created if no matching account exists on our site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_LINK_LABEL="Linkt"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_LINK_DESC="Links your user on this site from your Microsoft Account. You can then use your Microsoft Account to log in to this site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_UNLINK_LABEL="Unlink"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_UNLINK_DESC="Unlinks your user on this site from your Microsoft Account"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_APPID_LABEL="Microsoft Live SDK App Client ID"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_APPID_DESC="Enter the Client ID for your Microsoft Live SDK application here. This is required to enable social login with Microsoft Account. You can create a Microsoft Live SDK app through the Microsoft Application Registration Portal."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_APPSECRET_LABEL="Microsoft Live SDK App Client Secret"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_APPSECRET_DESC="Enter the Microsoft Live SDK Application Secret for your Microsoft Live SDK application here. This is required to enable social login with Microsoft Account. You can create a Microsoft Live SDK app through the Microsoft Application Registration Portal."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_LABEL="Allow social login to non-linked accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_DESC="When enabled allows users to log in despite not having linked their Microsoft Account to their site user account. Their Microsoft Account's email address must be the same as the email account they use on your site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL="Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Microsoft Account but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or Microsoft Account User ID. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The new Joomla! user will have a username derived from the Microsoft Account login, the same email address as the Microsoft Account and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Microsoft Account login."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_FORCENEW_LABEL="Ignore Joomla! setting for creating user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_FORCENEW_DESC="When both this option and the 'Create new user accounts' option above are enabled a new user will always be created, even if you have disabled user registration in the options of Joomla's Users page. This is useful to prevent anyone from registering to your site <em>unless</em> they have a Microsoft Account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_LABEL="Bypass user validation for Microsoft users"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_DESC="Only applies when creating new user accounts. When this option is enabled, the new Joomla! user will be created active, without going through the Joomla! user account validation. This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site. This is safe because Microsoft Account only allows users with a verified email address to hold a Microsoft Account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_LABEL="Button styling"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_DESC="When enabled custom CSS for login, link and unlink button styling will be output to the page header. Disable this option if you intend to use your own CSS to style the buttons."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_ICONCLASS_LABEL="Icon class"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_ICONCLASS_DESC="The icon CSS class to use in the login, link and unlink buttons. Useful to use an icon font such as FontAwesome or Glyphicons to render the logo. If it's left empty a transparent PNG image will be used instead - but it's slower to load!"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_ERROR_NOT_LOGGED_IN_FB="You are not logged into Microsoft Account or you didn't grant permissions for this site to log you in through Microsoft Account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_ERROR_LOCAL_NOT_FOUND="You do not have an account on this site that corresponds to this Microsoft Account."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_ERROR_LOCAL_USERNAME_CONFLICT="An account with the same username or email address as your Microsoft Account already exists on this site. Please log in to your account on this site and then link your Microsoft Account to it. If you do not remember having a user account yet please create a new one first."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_ERROR_CANNOT_CREATE="Could not create a new user on our site: %s"
