## Release highlights
 
**Joomla 4 compatibility**. SocialLogin will now work on Joomla 4 but support for it is experimental since J4 is still in beta. We have even added a cool integration with J4's support for additional login buttons... but it will have to wait for Joomla 4 beta 2 or 3 since there's currently a byg we've contributed a fix for and which is pending inclusion.
 
For more information and documentation for administrators, users and developers please [consult the documentation Wiki](https://github.com/akeeba/sociallogin/wiki).
