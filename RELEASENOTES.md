## Joomla and PHP Compatibility

Akeeba Social Login is compatible with Joomla! 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. Preliminary support for Joomla! 4.0 Alpha 2 is included in this version. See notes. It requires PHP 5.3.10 or later, the same minimum PHP version as Joomla! itself. It's also compatible with PHP 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2.

We strongly recommend using the latest published Joomla! version and PHP 7.0, 7.1 or 7.2 later _for optimal security of your site_.

### Preliminary Joomla! 4 support

Joomla! 4 is still in its very early development stages. While this version of SocialLogin has added preliminary support for Joomla! 4.0 Alpha 2 we cannot guarantee that it will work in any future release of Joomla! 4, be it development or stable. We reserve the right to remove Joomla! 4 compatibility and / or delegate this feature to a future version of our software.
