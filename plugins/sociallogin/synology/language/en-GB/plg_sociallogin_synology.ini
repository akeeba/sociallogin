PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SYNOLOGY_LINK_DESC="Links your user on this site with Synology SSO. You can then log into this site using Synology SSO."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SYNOLOGY_UNLINK_LABEL="Unlink Synology SSO"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SYNOLOGY_UNLINK_DESC="Unlinks your user account on this site from your Synology SSO account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SYNOLOGY_FIELD_APPID_LABEL="Application ID"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SYNOLOGY_FIELD_APPID_DESC="Enter the Application ID. You can create a new application and get this information by logging into Synology DSM and going to SSO Server, Application."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SYNOLOGY_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL="Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SYNOLOGY_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Synology SSO but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or Synology SSO username. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The new Joomla! user will have the same username as the Synology SSO account, the same email address as the Synology SSO account, a name in the form “Synology SSO User some_username”, and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Synology SSO login."

When this option is enabled, the new Joomla! user will be created active, without going through the Joomla! user account validation. This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site. This is safe because Synology SSO accounts are manually validated by the administrators of the Synology DSM instance you are using."
