PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_MICROSOFT_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Microsoft Account but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or Microsoft Account User ID.

The new Joomla! user will have a username derived from the Microsoft Account login, the same email address as the Microsoft Account and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Microsoft Account login."
