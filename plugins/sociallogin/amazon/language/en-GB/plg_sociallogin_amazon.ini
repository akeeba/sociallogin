PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_DESCRIPTION="Allows social login with Amazon accounts."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_LOGIN_LABEL="Login with Amazon"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_LOGIN_DESC="Login with your Amazon account. A new account will be created if no matching account exists on our site."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_LINK_LABEL="Link Amazon"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_LINK_DESC="Links your user on this site from your Amazon account. You can then use your Amazon account to log in to this site."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_UNLINK_LABEL="Unlink Amazon"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_UNLINK_DESC="Unlinks your user on this site from your Amazon account"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_APPID_LABEL="Amazon Client ID"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_APPID_DESC="Enter the Client ID for your Amazon OAuth2 application here. This is required to enable social login with Amazon. You can create a Amazon OAuth2 app free of charge at <a href='https://developer.amazon.com'>the Amazon developer portal</a>."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_APPSECRET_LABEL="Amazon Client Secret"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_APPSECRET_DESC="Enter the Client Secret for your Amazon OAuth2 application here. This is required to enable social login with Amazon. You can create a Amazon OAuth2 app free of charge at <a href='https://developer.amazon.com'>the Amazon developer portal</a>."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_LABEL="Allow social login to non-linked accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_DESC="When enabled allows users to log in despite not having linked their Amazon account to their site user account. Their Amazon account's email address must be the same as the email account they use on your site and it must be publicly visible."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL="Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Amazon but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or Amazon User ID. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The user's Amazon account must have a publicly visible email address. The new Joomla! user will have a username derived from the Amazon login, the same email address as the Amazon account and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Amazon login."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_FORCENEW_LABEL="Ignore Joomla! setting for creating user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_FORCENEW_DESC="When both this option and the 'Create new user accounts' option above are enabled a new user will always be created, even if you have disabled user registration in the options of Joomla's Users page. This is useful to prevent anyone from registering to your site <em>unless</em> they have a Amazon account."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_LABEL="Bypass user validation for Amazon users"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_DESC="Only applies when creating new user accounts. When this option is enabled, the new Joomla! user will be created active, without going through the Joomla! user account validation. This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site. This is safe because Amazon only allows users with a verified email address to use their Amazon account to login to external sites."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_LABEL="Button styling"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_AMAZON_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_DESC="When enabled custom CSS for login, link and unlink button styling will be output to the page header. Disable this option if you intend to use your own CSS to style the buttons."

Please log in to your account on this site and then link your Amazon account to it. If you do not remember having a user account yet please create a new one first."
