PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_LOGIN_DESC="Login with your Google account. A new account will be created if no matching account exists on our site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_LINK_LABEL="Link Google"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_LINK_DESC="Links your user on this site from your Google account. You can then use your Google account to log in to this site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_UNLINK_LABEL="Unlink Google"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_UNLINK_DESC="Unlinks your user on this site from your Google account"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_APPID_LABEL="Google Client ID"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_APPID_DESC="Enter the Client ID for your Google API project here. This is required to enable social login with Google. You can create a Google API project at https://console.developers.google.com/apis"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_APPSECRET_LABEL="Google Client Secret"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_APPSECRET_DESC="Enter the Client Secret for your Google API project here. This is required to enable social login with Google. You can create a Google API project at https://console.developers.google.com/apis"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_LABEL="Allow social login to non-linked accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_DESC="When enabled allows users to log in despite not having linked their Google account to their site user account. Their Google account's email address must be the same as the email account they use on your site (do note that Google has checked the validity of their email address)."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL="Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Google but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or Google User ID. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The new Joomla! user will have a username derived from the Google login, the same email address as the Google account and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Google login."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_FORCENEW_LABEL="Ignore Joomla! setting for creating user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_FORCENEW_DESC="When both this option and the 'Create new user accounts' option above are enabled a new user will always be created, even if you have disabled user registration in the options of Joomla's Users page. This is useful to prevent anyone from registering to your site <em>unless</em> they have a Google account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_LABEL="Bypass user validation"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_DESC="Only applies when creating new user accounts. Google has already verified that the email address linked to this person't Google account is under their control. This makes going through the Joomla! user account validation unnecessary. By enabling this option the Joomla! account verification will therefore be bypassed. This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_LABEL="Button styling"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_GOOGLE_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_DESC="When enabled custom CSS for login, link and unlink button styling will be output to the page header. Disable this option if you intend to use your own CSS to style the buttons."
