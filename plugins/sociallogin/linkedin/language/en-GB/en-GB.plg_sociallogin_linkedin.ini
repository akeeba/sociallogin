PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN="Akeeba Social Login - LinkedIn integration"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_DESCRIPTION="Allows social login with LinkedIn accounts."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_LOGIN_LABEL="Sign in with LinkedIn"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_LOGIN_DESC="Login with your LinkedIn account. A new account will be created if no matching account exists on our site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_LINK_LABEL="Link LinkedIn"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_LINK_DESC="Links your user on this site from your LinkedIn account. You can then use your LinkedIn account to log in to this site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_UNLINK_LABEL="Unlink LinkedIn"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_UNLINK_DESC="Unlinks your user on this site from your LinkedIn account"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_APPID_LABEL="LinkedIn Client ID"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_APPID_DESC="Enter the Client ID for your LinkedIn OAuth application here. This is required to enable social login with LinkedIn. You can create a LinkedIn app through LinkedIn Developer platform."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_APPSECRET_LABEL="LinkedIn Client Secret"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_APPSECRET_DESC="Enter the Client Secret for your LinkedIn OAuth application here. This is required to enable social login with LinkedIn. You can create a LinkedIn app through the LinkedIn Developer platform."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_LABEL="Allow social login to non-linked accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_DESC="When enabled allows users to log in despite not having linked their LinkedIn account to their site user account. Their LinkedIn account's email address must be the same as the email account they use on your site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL="Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via LinkedIn but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or LinkedIn User ID. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The new Joomla! user will have a username derived from the LinkedIn login, the same email address as the LinkedIn account and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through LinkedIn login."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_FORCENEW_LABEL="Ignore Joomla! setting for creating user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_FORCENEW_DESC="When both this option and the 'Create new user accounts' option above are enabled a new user will always be created, even if you have disabled user registration in the options of Joomla's Users page. This is useful to prevent anyone from registering to your site <em>unless</em> they have a LinkedIn account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_LABEL="Bypass user validation for LinkedIn users"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_DESC="Only applies when creating new user accounts. When this option is enabled, the new Joomla! user will be created active, without going through the Joomla! user account validation. This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site. This is safe because LinkedIn only allows users with a verified email address to hold a LinkedIn account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_IMAGEBUTTON_LABEL="Use image button"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_IMAGEBUTTON_DESC="Set to Yes to use the LinkedIn-prescribed image to display the login button. Do note that disabling this option may violate the Terms of Service for Sign In with LinkedIn."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_LABEL="Button styling"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_DESC="When enabled custom CSS for login, link and unlink button styling will be output to the page header. Disable this option if you intend to use your own CSS to style the buttons."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_ICONCLASS_LABEL="Icon class"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_FIELD_ICONCLASS_DESC="The icon CSS class to use in the login, link and unlink buttons. Useful to use an icon font such as FontAwesome or Glyphicons to render the logo. If it's left empty a transparent PNG image will be used instead - but it's slower to load!"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_ERROR_NOT_LOGGED_IN_FB="You are not logged into LinkedIn or you didn't grant permissions for this site to log you in through LinkedIn."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_ERROR_ACCOUNT_DISABLED_OR_NOT_ACTIVATED="Your account on this site is disabled or not activated."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_ERROR_LOCAL_NOT_FOUND="You do not have an account on this site that corresponds to this LinkedIn account."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_ERROR_LOCAL_USERNAME_CONFLICT="An account with the same username or email address as your LinkedIn account already exists on this site. Please log in to your account on this site and then link your LinkedIn account to it. If you do not remember having a user account yet please create a new one first."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_ERROR_CANNOT_CREATE="Could not create a new user on our site: %s"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_LINKEDIN_NOTICE_USERACTIVATE="Your email address needs to be verified before logging in to this site. An email has been sent to you with instructions. After following these instructions please come back here and retry logging in to this site using LinkedIn."
