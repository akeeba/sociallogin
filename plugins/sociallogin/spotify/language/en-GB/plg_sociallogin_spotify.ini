PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_DESCRIPTION = "Allows social login with Spotify accounts."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_LOGIN_LABEL = "Login with Spotify"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_LOGIN_DESC = "Login with your Spotify account. A new account will be created if no matching account exists on our site."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_LINK_LABEL = "Link Spotify"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_LINK_DESC = "Links your user on this site from your Spotify account. You can then use your Spotify account to log in to this site."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_UNLINK_LABEL = "Unlink Spotify"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_UNLINK_DESC = "Unlinks your user on this site from your Spotify account"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_APPID_LABEL = "Spotify Client ID"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_APPID_DESC = "Enter the Client ID for your Spotify OAuth2 application here. This is required to enable social login with Spotify. You can create a Spotify OAuth2 app free of charge at <a href='https://developer.spotify.com'>the Spotify developer portal</a>."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_APPSECRET_LABEL = "Spotify Client Secret"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_APPSECRET_DESC = "Enter the Client Secret for your Spotify OAuth2 application here. This is required to enable social login with Spotify. You can create a Spotify OAuth2 app free of charge at <a href='https://developer.spotify.com'>the Spotify developer portal</a>."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_LABEL = "Allow social login to non-linked accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_DESC = "When enabled allows users to log in despite not having linked their Spotify account to their site user account. Their Spotify account's email address must be the same as the email account they use on your site and it must be publicly visible."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL = "Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC = "Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Spotify but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or Spotify User ID. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The user's Spotify account must have a publicly visible email address. The new Joomla! user will have a username derived from the Spotify login, the same email address as the Spotify account and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Spotify login."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_FORCENEW_LABEL = "Ignore Joomla! setting for creating user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_FORCENEW_DESC = "When both this option and the 'Create new user accounts' option above are enabled a new user will always be created, even if you have disabled user registration in the options of Joomla's Users page. This is useful to prevent anyone from registering to your site <em>unless</em> they have a Spotify account."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_LABEL = "Bypass user validation for Spotify users"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_DESC = "Only applies when creating new user accounts. When this option is enabled, the new Joomla! user will be created active, without going through the Joomla! user account validation. This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site. This is safe because Spotify only allows users with a verified email address to use their Spotify account to login to external sites."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_LABEL = "Button styling"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_DESC = "When enabled custom CSS for login, link and unlink button styling will be output to the page header. Disable this option if you intend to use your own CSS to style the buttons."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_ERROR_LOCAL_NOT_FOUND = "You do not have an account on this site that corresponds to this Spotify account; or you have chosen not to share your email address in your public Spotify profile (this means we can't identify you)."
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_SPOTIFY_ERROR_LOCAL_USERNAME_CONFLICT = "An account with the same username or email address as your Spotify account already exists on this site; or you have chosen not to share your email address in your public Spotify profile (this means we can't identify you). Please log in to your account on this site and then link your Spotify account to it. If you do not remember having a user account yet please create a new one first."
