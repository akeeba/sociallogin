PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_LOGIN_LABEL="<small>Log-in with</small> Apple"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_LOGIN_DESC="Login with your Apple ID. A new account will be created if no matching account exists on our site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_LINK_LABEL="Link Apple"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_LINK_DESC="Links your user on this site with your Apple ID. You can then use your Apple ID to log in to this site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_UNLINK_LABEL="Unlink Apple"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_UNLINK_DESC="Unlinks your user on this site from your Apple ID"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_CLIENTID_LABEL="Client ID"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_CLIENTID_DESC=""

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_CLIENTSECRET_LABEL="Client Secret"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_CLIENTSECRET_DESC=""

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL="Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Apple ID but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that Apple ID. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The new Joomla! user will have a random username, the same email address as the one returned by Apple (might be a proxy email address) and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Apple login."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_FORCENEW_LABEL="Ignore Joomla! setting for creating user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_FORCENEW_DESC="When both this option and the 'Create new user accounts' option above are enabled a new user will always be created, even if you have disabled user registration in the options of Joomla's Users page. This is useful to prevent anyone from registering to your site <em>unless</em> they have a Apple account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_LABEL="Bypass user validation for Apple users"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_DESC="Only applies when creating new user accounts. If Apple says that the user trying to login is most likely a real human (based on their own, opaque heuristics) the new user will be created active, without going through the Joomla! user account validation. This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_LABEL="Button styling"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_DESC="When enabled custom CSS for login, link and unlink button styling will be output to the page header. Disable this option if you intend to use your own CSS to style the buttons."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_ICONCLASS_LABEL="Icon class"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_APPLE_FIELD_ICONCLASS_DESC="The icon CSS class to use in the login, link and unlink buttons. Useful to use an icon font such as FontAwesome or Glyphicons to render the logo. If it's left empty a transparent PNG image will be used instead - but it's slower to load!"
