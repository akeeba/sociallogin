PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_LINK_LABEL="Link Twitter"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_LINK_DESC="Links your user on this site from your Twitter account. You can then use your Twitter account to log in to this site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_UNLINK_LABEL="Unlink Twitter"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_UNLINK_DESC="Unlinks your user on this site from your Twitter account"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_APPID_LABEL="Twitter Client ID"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_APPID_DESC="Enter the Client ID for your Twitter App here. This is required to enable social login with Twitter. You can create a Twitter App at https://apps.twitter.com/app"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_APPSECRET_LABEL="Twitter Client Secret"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_APPSECRET_DESC="Enter the Client Secret for your Twitter App here. This is required to enable social login with Twitter. You can create a Twitter App at https://apps.twitter.com/app"

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_LABEL="Allow social login to non-linked accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_LOGINUNLINKED_DESC="When enabled allows users to log in despite not having linked their Twitter account to their site user account. Their Twitter account's email address must be the same as the email account they use on your site (do note that Twitter has checked the validity of their email address)."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_CREATENEW_LABEL="Create new user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_CREATENEW_DESC="Creates a new Joomla! user when a user tries to log in via Twitter but there is no Joomla! user account associated with that email or Twitter User ID. If user registration is disabled no account will be created and an error will be raised. The new Joomla! user will have a username derived from the Twitter login, the same email address as the Twitter account and a long, random password (which the user can change once they have logged in). Set this to No to prevent creation of user accounts through Twitter login."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_FORCENEW_LABEL="Ignore Joomla! setting for creating user accounts"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_FORCENEW_DESC="When both this option and the 'Create new user accounts' option above are enabled a new user will always be created, even if you have disabled user registration in the options of Joomla's Users page. This is useful to prevent anyone from registering to your site <em>unless</em> they have a Twitter account."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_LABEL="Bypass user validation"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_BYPASSVALIDATION_DESC="Only applies when creating new user accounts. Twitter has already verified that the email address linked to this person't Twitter account is under their control. This makes going through the Joomla! user account validation unnecessary. By enabling this option the Joomla! account verification will therefore be bypassed. This means that no account activation email will be sent to the user or the administrators of the Joomla! site."

PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_LABEL="Button styling"
PLG_SOCIALLOGIN_TWITTER_FIELD_CUSTOMCSS_DESC="When enabled custom CSS for login, link and unlink button styling will be output to the page header. Disable this option if you intend to use your own CSS to style the buttons."
