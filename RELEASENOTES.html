<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Updated for Joomla 4 beta 7</strong>.
	This release addresses compatibility issues with Joomla 3 beta 7. Please only use the Joomla 4 method for inhjecting the social login buttons on Joomla 4. Disabling that option will result in the buttons being inserted twice. This is a known issue we are not going to address (it's only meant as a stop-gap for Joomla 3 which lacks support for additional login buttons).
