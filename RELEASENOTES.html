<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Removed Twitter integration</strong>. Twitter has now made it impossible to use it for logging in a user on the web without using Twitter's JavaScript library which invades user privacy, therefore nullifying the reason of SocialLogin's existence. As a result, the Twitter integration is now removed.
