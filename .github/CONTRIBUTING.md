Thank you for your interest in contributing to Akeeba software.

We welcome contributions which aim to improve our Free and Open Source Software
with respect to the project goals and the needs and interests of its community.
We request that all contributors and community members respect our Code of 
Conduct.

## Contributing code

If you have an interesting feature or feature change we encourage you to discuss
it with the maintainers first. The maintainers of the software have the ultimate
and ongoing responsibility of maintaining any code you submit, support it and 
defend it with other community members. Every feature or code change is, therefore,
a big ask on the time and focus of maintainers that goes in scope far beyond the
original time spent to write the code. As a result, the maintainers have the
final say on whether a contribution will be accepted or not and will provide an
explanation either way.

If your contribution is accepted in principle you will need to write the code and
make a Pull Request to the corresponding project. The maintainers will review in
due time and provide you with their feedbacks. Kindly note that submitting a PR
is not a guarantee that your code contribution will be accepted _even if your
code change was previously accepted in principle_. New considerations may have
come in scope or, simply, the code may not be up to par with the code quality the
maintainers wish for the project.

## Contributing documentation

The documentation wikis are normally read-only to everyone except the maintainers.
If you spotted a small documentation issue please file a GitHub issue on the
corresponding project of the type “Other issue”. 

If you want to contribute a substantial amount of documentation please contact the
maintainers through our [contact page](https://www.akeeba.com/contact-us.html) to
get write access to the wiki. Alternatively, you can submit a Pull Request for the
wiki content. If it's your first time contributing documentation we may request
that you go through the PR process before we can trust you with write access to
the documentation content.

## Contributing support

If you have the time and inclination you are welcome to submit replies to existing
GitHub issues submitted by other users, even if those issues are for generic 
support requests which the maintainers will not reply to. Please do state that you
are a volunteer community member in your replies to avoid any confusion on the 
part of the original poster.

If in the course of support you discover a coding issue please at-mention one of
the maintainers for further review of the issue and do state whether you intend to
make a Pull Request with a code fix yourself.
