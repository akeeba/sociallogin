### Backwards compatibility

Does this PR break backwards compatibility? Is it a minor break (template overrides need to be updated) or a hard b/c break (code interfacing with the public API, e.g. plugins, need to be rewritten)?

If it does break b/c document how it breaks it and what other developers making plugins or template overrides for LoginGuard should do.
