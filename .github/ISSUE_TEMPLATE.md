Please read the README.md in the repository's root before submitting an issue.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

Be specific. You may link to one or more screenshots or a video as long as it's not the only clue you leave. Use words to describe what happens.

Make sure your issue can be reproduced on a new installation of Joomla! without any modified configuration settings or third party extensions. If the issue only occurs with a specific third party extension or configuration setting please specify exactly what triggers it. Always keep in mind that if it can't be reproduced it can't be fixed!

Please do read the documentation first and make sure you've configured the social network login integration properly.
