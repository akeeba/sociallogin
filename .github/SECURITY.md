# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `master` and `development` branches are supported with security updates. The `master` branch represents the last published version, whereas the `development` branch represents the upcoming version.

We only support the latest published, stable Joomla version in the 3.x and 4.x branch. We do not support alphas, betas or release candidates (testing releases). If a security issue only occurs with a testing release we will consider it but we cannot promise a rapid respolution.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a GitHub issue about security issues. GitHub issues are public.
Filing an issue about a security issue puts all users, you included, in immediate danger.

Please use our [contact page](https://www.akeebabackup.com/contact-us.html) to send us a
private notification about the security issue. We strongly recommend using GPG to encrypt
your email. You can find the lead developer's public GPG key at https://keybase.io/nikosdion

Please include instructions to reproduce the security issue. Better yet, please include Proof
Of Concept code if applicable.

## Expected timeframe

TL;DR - Typical timeframe:

* T-2 to 10 days: we receive your notification about a security issue.
* T-0: we acknowledge the security issue and start working on it.
* T+30 days: we release a patched version and you can make an announcement without details or POC code.
* T+90 days: you can talk about it in public without any restriction, release POC code etc.

Security issues are typically processed within 2 business days with the exception of vacations,
event attendance or family emergencies. We will contact you to let you know of our evaluation of
the security issue and possibly request more information.

As soon as we acknowledge an issue we typically ask for 30 days to come up with a solution and release
a fixed version. We kindly request that no announcement about the security issue is made in public
during that period of time. You will be credited with the discovery of the vulnerability in our release
notes and our release announcements (if any). You may not receive a notification about the release of
the new version but we encourage you to monitor our automated release update feed.

Once this time period elapses and / or we have released a fixed version you are free to make a public
announcement about your vulnerability as long as you do not give away specifics or proof-of-concept
code. We kindly request that you give an additional 60 days for our users to have a chance to update
their software.

After the additional 60 days you are more than welcome to release detailed information and
proof-of-concept code, as well as make any public announcements about the vulnerability you 
discovered.
