## Support philosophy

The software is provided free of charge. Personalised support and custom 
development for it is not. 

Please note that some repositories are marked as "INTERNAL" or "NO SUPPORT"
in their README.md. No support at all will be provided for these 
repositories including but not limited to bug reports, feature requests, 
paid support and paid custom development. The status of these repositories 
as internal / no support overrides and supersedes everything else described
in this document. In an attempt to avoid confusion we try to make GitHub 
Issues inaccessible to the public on such repositories where support is
unavailable.

On all other repositories we will be happy to discuss bug reports and 
feature requests free of charge and only through GitHub issues in the 
relevant repository as long as the conditions outlined in this document are
met.

Please remember that we only provide limited free of charge support for bug
reports and feature requests in the context of furthering the interests of
the target audience of our software _in general_, not just specific 
individuals. Think of it as tending to the community garden everyone can use
and enjoy, not fencing parts of it off so that only specific people are 
allowed to use it.

## Be respectful

First and foremost, be respectful. All interactions with community members,
contributors and maintainers are subject to the Code of Conduct.

## Free Software does not mean free-of-charge services

Kindly note that the word “Free” in the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
designation of the software refers to _freedom of choice_, not lack of
cost, as explained [by the Free Software Foundation itself](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.en.html).
If you don't understand why that link is important: it's by the same people
who wrote the GNU General Public License our software is licensed under and
who founded the Free Software movement itself.

Using our free of charge, FOSS software does not create any kind of business
or other relationship between us, does not grant you any privileges and does 
not mean that we are obliged to offer any service level whatsoever free of 
charge. 

You are _free to choose_ whether you want to use our FOSS software and the 
resources we make available to you free of charge. You are also free to 
choose whether to use the limited free of charge support we offer or not.
You are, however, not entitled to any privileges or special treatment just 
by merit of using our software. 

## Policy on bug reports

Bug reports are only considered for free of charge resolution by the 
maintainers when the issue is reproducible given your instructions on a site
and hosting _different than yours_. 

If your issue can only be reproduced on your site and / or hosting please try
to isolate what is causing the problem and give us more accurate instructions
which helps us reproduce the issue. Only then can we investigate whether it's
a legitimate bug with our software or a problem with your site or hosting 
environment. 

If your issue does not meet this reproducibility criteria, if it's unrelated to
our software or is something already documented we will probably close your 
GitHub issue without further commentary.

## Policy on feature requests

We will be happy to discuss and consider feature requests with a justified
reasoning behind them. At the very least we expect you to tell us what is the
problem you are trying to solve, which alternatives you have considered and why
you believe that your proposal is a good fit for our community in general (i.e.
show us that you are not assuming that you are fully representing the entire 
community).

Please do keep in mind that your requested feature change or addition is 
something which has to be developed, supported, maintained and defended by the
maintainers of the project in perpetuity. As a result only feature changes or
additions which make sense for the overall community will be considered. Moreover,
the decision on whether a feature will be implemented at all, when it will happen
and how it will happen lies exclusively with the maintainers and no promises are
made on a timeframe.

## Paid support

We encourage you to read our documentation Wiki and try to figure out a solution
to your issue yourself. Our software is typically reasonably simple to use. 
Whenever there are tricky conditions such as the need to configure a third party
service for use with our software or the need to do template overrides or other
Joomla or hosting specific configuration to use our software we do document it.

If you are unable to find a solution just by using the documentation we encourage
you to seek peer support in the Joomla Forum or your local Joomla User Group,
either in person or through their Facebook page / local forum. The chances are
someone else has either run into the same issue or understands how to fix it.

If you still cannot find a solution to your issue or do not have time to go 
through the free-of-charge, community-driven support outlined above you can 
always hire the maintainers to provide you with personalised support for a 
very reasonable fee.

If you submit a bug report or other issue that is not a legitimate bug report 
per the criteria outlined above the maintainers will remind you of this policy 
and let you decide whether you want to close your issue or continue with paid
support.

## Paid development

We encourage you to first discuss a feature you'd like to see implemented with
the maintainers. The maintainers will tell you if this is a feature that is a good
fit with for the overall community or not. If it's a good fit you will be told
if there is a timeframe for its development or whether no committment can be made
at that time.

It is understood that in some cases you desperately need a feature to be 
implemented that the maintainers have rejected o told you it may be considered for 
a future version without a time committment. In these cases you generally have
three choices:

* You can wait for the maintainers to implement this feature (obviously only 
  applies to features not rejected outright).
* You can implement it yourself e.g. by hiring a third party developer.
* You can hire a maintainer to implement it for you for a reasonable fee.

In the latter case, if it's a feature we told you we are not interested in or
find to be not a good fit for the community we would create a custom version of
the software for you, with that feature implemented. However, there are no 
guarantees that this version can or will be maintained. This kind of work would
have to be paid extra.

If you hire us to accelerate the development of a feature we said we would 
consider without committing to a timeframe you understand that the feature will
be part of our software and evenrually made available to other users of the
software.

## General information about paid services

We are not obliged to accept any request for paid support or development. Our 
acceptance is subject to avaialbility and our assessment of the objective 
feasibility and legality of what is being asked.

Please bear in mind that the maintainers will not reject bug reports or feature
requests just so that you can spend money with us. If your starting position
is one of mistrust towards us please do not submit a GitHub issue to save both
of us a lot of time and frustration.

Paid services do come with an invoice, no matter if you are a business or a
natural person. We do not accept cash “donations” or other non-monetary 
“gifts” in exchange for services.
